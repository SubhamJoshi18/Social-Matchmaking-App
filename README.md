Project Overview

This project is a next-generation social and matchmaking app that uses AI and machine learning to provide personalized match suggestions. Users can find connections based on similarities or explore relationships with intentionally dissimilar profiles. Our goal is to create meaningful interactions while ensuring data privacy and security.

Core Features

User Registration & Authentication

Secure signup and login using JWT or OAuth (Google/Facebook).

Email verification and password recovery support.

Profile Management

Users can manage personal details such as:

Name, age, location, and demographics.

Interests, hobbies, and relationship preferences.

Political views, children preferences, guilty pleasures, likes/dislikes, etc.

AI/ML Matching System

Similarity Matching: Suggests users with similar profiles.

Dissimilarity Matching: Connects users with intentionally different profiles.

Dynamic Learning: Improves recommendations as users provide more data.

Privacy Controls

Users can control the visibility of their data.

User Interaction

Messaging and connection requests.

Notifications for matches.

Tech Stack

Frontend

Framework: React with TypeScript or Next.js.

Mobile Option: React Native or Flutter.

UI Libraries: Material-UI, TailwindCSS.

Backend

Language: Node.js with Express.js or .NET Core.

Database: PostgreSQL (structured data) and MongoDB (unstructured preferences).

Authentication: JWT and OAuth.

APIs: RESTful APIs or GraphQL.

AI/ML

Language: Python.

Libraries:

scikit-learn: Clustering and similarity models.

TensorFlow or PyTorch: Deep learning models.

Models:

Collaborative Filtering for recommendations.

K-Means or DBSCAN for clustering.

NLP for analyzing textual data.

Deployment

Frontend: Netlify or Vercel.

Backend: Render or AWS.

Database: AWS RDS or MongoDB Atlas.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.

AI/ML Matching System

Model Design

Feature Engineering:

Convert user data into numerical vectors.

Use one-hot encoding for categorical data (e.g., political views).

Normalize numerical fields (e.g., age).

Similarity Matching:

Cosine Similarity to measure profile similarity.

K-Means clustering to group similar users.

Dissimilarity Matching:

Identify maximum distance profiles using Euclidean distance.

Improving Model Performance:

Reinforcement Learning for improving suggestions based on user feedback.

Collaborative Filtering to leverage similar usersâ€™ interactions.

Data Privacy and Security

Encryption: Secure sensitive data using encryption.

Compliance: Adherence to GDPR and CCPA regulations.

Anonymization: Use anonymized data for training AI/ML models.

Development Roadmap

Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
